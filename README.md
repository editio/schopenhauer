# Schopenhauer's Library. Annotations and marks in his Spanish books

The scholarly digital edition was built in 2017 using Drupal and TEICHI (a Drupal module) from a single TEI XML file. Due to security updates and version issues (both with Drupal and TEICHI), the site could no longer be maintained, so it was converted to a basic html, css and javascript site. Some features like search were lost in the conversion.

This repo is a working backup of the website at <https://schopenhauer.uni.wroc.pl>, which is also available here at <https://editio.github.io/schopenhauer>.
