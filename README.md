# Schopenhauer's Library. Annotations and marks in his Spanish books

This repo is a working backup of the website schopenhauer.uni.wroc.pl (temporally unavailable).

The scholarly digital edition was built in 2017 using Drupal and TEICHI (Drupal module). Due to security updates and version issues (both with Drupal and TEICHI), the site could no longer be maintained, so the site was converted to a basic html, css and javascript site. Some features like search were lost in the conversion.

The edition can be visited at <https://editio.github.io/schopenhauer>
